The chat conversation for this assignment begins at Prompt 18. At the first time, it gave a working prompt. Then, after it was asked to elaborate the story more, it stopped working seamlessly. It was simply asked to elaborate more on the story. I wanted it to add a third option so the game wouldn't be so short, but was unable to move ast adding this 3rd option to each step. The code included all choices and instances of where the game should move, but the interface was glitchy and stopped showing the options. You only get to select an option at the start of the game, then no matter what is chosen, you see the next step of the story but are unable to react to it.
